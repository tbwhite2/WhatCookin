Super Late Submission to the What's Cooking Kaggle Competition, just for fun :)

## Kaggle Komp
Code in this repo is related to the data found in [this competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/whats-cooking-kernels-only/data).  The competition is old (no prize possible at this point) but its an interesting problem of classifying the cuisne type based on the ingredients found in a dish.  I plan to make a few submissions, iterating over techniques and data models.  I'm also planning to do some non competition fun stuff with this data.
